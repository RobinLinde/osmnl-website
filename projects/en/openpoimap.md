OpenPoiMap is a user-friendly tool to find certain tags/POIs on OpenStreetMap. There is a choice of a large part of the categories defined in the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features#Amenity). By clicking on a point, the tags are visible, including references to the wiki. The tool is available on [openpoimap.org](https://openpoimap.org/)
