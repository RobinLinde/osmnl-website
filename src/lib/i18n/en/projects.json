		"description": "To give a clear indication of what mapping layers are available for use in OpenStreetMap, Allroads has created a map that shows the layers and their licenses. The map shows layers that have been agreed upon, or layers that have a Public Domain license. More information can also be found on the [forum](https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=66737). It can be found [here](http://mijndev.openstreetmap.nl/~allroads/NLOSMOK/OSMOKNL.html)."
